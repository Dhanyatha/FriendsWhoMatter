ProjectMickey
=============
This project is based on the research paper titled "Social Networks that matter". The research paper states that even though
users declare a lot of friends on twitter, they often make regular conversations with limited number of friends. These 
individuals are the network of real friends of the user. The paper defines a real friend as someone to whom the user has 
directed his tweets atleast twice.This network is identified as more influential yet simpler compared
to the large network of individuals just declared as friends. Exploiting this network is beneficial for effective propagation 
of ideas.

This project aims at analyzing the relationship between various parameters like number of friends,followers, number of posts etc.
by using visual representations like graphs & histograms(exploratory data analysis). The results were compared with those
in the research paper,"Social Networks that matter".
